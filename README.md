# bdo-assignment

## 🚀 Overview

This is a Google Cloud Run service for processing financial statement PDFs and evaluating classification accuracy via two HTTP endpoints:

### 🔹 `/classification`
- Extracts text from each page of a PDF.
- Classifies pages into types like **Balance Sheet**, **Income Statement**, etc.
- Saves classification results as CSV in a **Google Cloud Storage** bucket.

### 🔹 `/evaluation-metrics`
- Compares classification results with a ground truth CSV.
- Returns evaluation metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
